.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm 
is a simple tool for retrieving the management information from a 
server using SNMP (Simple Network Managment Protocol).
Depending on the options it constructs either a SMNP GetRequest, GetNextRequest 
or a GetBulkRequest packet, fills in the OIDs (object identifiers) of the
objects whose values will be retrived, waits for a responce and prints it if
received successfully. 
.Sh OPTIONS 
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".It Fl D Ar options"
.It Fl a
Skip any sanity checks when adding OIDs to PDU - ingore syntax/access type or 
for GetPdu allow adding of non-leaf objects.
.It Fl b Ar buffersize
Use this to tune the size of the buffers that are used to send and receive
the packets.
The default size is 10000 bytes which should be fair enough unless server wants
to send you a really large octetstring - 65535 is the maximum allowed length
according to SMIv2 (Structure of Management Information).
.It Fl d
Turn debugging on - currently this option will cause the sent and received 
packets to be dumped to the terminal.
.It Fl e
Retry on error.
When error is returned in responce PDU, resend request removing the variable
that caused the error until a valid responce is received.
Use for Get/GetNext PDU.
.It Fl h
This option prints a short help text and some options' default values.
.It Fl I Ar options
Include each of the files in the list, applying the given options:
.Bl -tag -width
.It Cm cut=OID
This options specifies the initial OID that was cut by
.Xr gensnmpdef 1
when producing the file.
The default value is 1.3.6 which is perfectly OK for all files installed under
/usr/share/snmp/defs/.
Use this only if you produced your own files, providing a '-c' option to
.Xr gensnmpdef 1 .
.It Cm path=filedir
The directory where files in the list will be searched.
.It Cm file=filelist
The list of files to be added.
.El
The suboptions need not necessarily be in the order given but file suboption
should be last so that the previousy processed suboptions may be applied to each
of the files in the list.
Suboptions may be separated either by commas or by white-spaces - the whole
options string has to be given in double-quotes in that case.
.It Fl i Ar filelist
List of files produced by 
.Xr gensnmpdef 1 where
.Nm bsnmpget
will search for the numerical OID to string mapping. Multiple files can be
provided with multiple -i switches or after a single switch in a list separated
with commas.
If a filename begins with a letter, the default directory it will be searched
under is /usr/share/snmp/defs.
.It Fl l Ar filename
When local transport (unix socket) is used, use this option to specify the
filename of the socket.
.It Fl M Ar max-repetitions
Specify value for max-repetitions field in a GetBulk PDU.
Default is 1.
.It Fl N Ar non-repeaters
Specify value for non-repeaters field in a GetBulk PDU.
Default is 0.
.It Fl n
Read input OID and output responce OIDs numerically rather than search for their
corresponding strings.
Note that
.Nm bsnmpget 
will print numerical OIDs anyway if it can't find their corresponding string in
the file(s) it uses to lookup the match.
.It Fl o Ar output
Specify the way received responce is output - one of : short, verbose or quiet.
Default is short.
Verbose will print the variable syntax abbreviated before printing the value and
quiet will print only received values.
.It Fl p Ar pdu
The PDU type to send - one of : get, getnext or getbulk.
Default is get.
.It Fl r Ar retries
Number of request packets to send before giving up if server doesn't respond. 
Default is 3 if option is not provided.
One might also want to start counting from 0 instead of 1 - thus if value 2 is
provided 
.Nm bsnmpget
will actually send three packets (there's a bug somewhere in the code that needs
to be fixed).
.It Fl s Ar trans:: Ns Ar community@ Ns Ar server Ns Ar :port
Each of the server specifications components is optional but at least one should
be provided after the '-s' option.
Server specification is constructed in the following manner:
.Bl -tag -width 
.It Cm trans::
Transport type may be one of  udp, stream or dgram.
If this option is not provided udp will be used, which is the typical.
stream stands for local stream socket and dgram is for local datagram socket.
.It Cm community@
Specify a SNMP community string to be used when sending packets.
If option is skipped the default "public" will be used.
.It Cm server
This might be either the server's ip address or the server's hostname.
If skipped a request to localhost will be sent.
.It Cm port
The destination port to send the requests to.
The default port on which SNMP agents listen is 161 but if you know your agent
is listening on some other port you migth want to use that.
.El
.It Fl t Ar timeout
Number of seconds before resending the request packet if server doesn't respond
 - the default value is 3 sec.
.It Fl v Ar version
Set the SNMP protocol version to use when sending the requests.
Currently only SNMP version 1 and 2 are supported - if no version option is
provided
.Nm bsnmpget 
will use a SNMPv2.
Note that GetBulkRequest PDUs were introduced in SNMPv2 so setting the version
to 1 is incompatiable with sending a GetBulk PDU.
.It OID
The object identifier whose value is to be retrived.
At least one OID should be provided to 
.Nm bsnmpget
to be able to send a request.
Any of formats used to print a single variable by
.Nm bsnmpget
is valid for inpit OID as well:
.Bl -tag -width
.It 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1.0
.It sysDescr
.It ifPhysAddress.1
.It ifRcvAddressStatus.2.6.255.255.255.255.255.255
.It ifRcvAddressType[2,ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]
.It ifRcvAddressStatus[Integer:1,OctetString:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff] (requires '-o
verbose' option)
.El
Square brackets are used to denote an entry's indexes.
When used in input OID, the OID has to be closed in double-quotes.
Note there is no difference between ifName.1 and "ifName[1]".
